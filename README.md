# UFOs
Using data stored in JavaScript to build a table with filters and placing it into an HTML file.

## Project Overview 
Used JavaScript to store and hold data about UFO sightings. JavaScript is also used to build tables and fill the table with the data from a JavaScript file with data. The data is displayed using HTML.

The challege project was to create mulitple filters to filter the table in the HTML file. The additional filters created were City, State, Country, and Shape.

## Resources
- Data Sources: data.js
- Software: JavaScript 1.8.5, HTML 5, CSS 3

## Summary
JavaScript was used to create tables and filters for UFO sightings data that was also stored in a JavaScript file. The table was filled with the data and displayed using HTML.

1. First coded a function to create a table using JavaScript
2. Created a code that displayed the filter box and that would filter out the date in the table.
3. Coded an HTML template to create a display for the new data.
4. Created a header to show the title and a subtitle and paragraph description below.
5. Placed the filter box and table below that.
6. Added in links to the HTML file to grab the data from data.js
7. Opened the HTML file and tested to see if the filter worked.

The challenge project was to create multiple filters for City, State, Country, and Shape. The code was written with if statements to stack the filters.

1. First created the function with the updated filters using and if statement to add the called filter onto a filtered list or clear it from the filters object.
2. Created a filtered table function that would loop through the list of filters and grab the data from the table that would match the filters.
3. Attached an event to listen for changes within the filtered list.

## Analysis
JavaScript is a useful tool to create filtered tables that can be displayed in an HTML file. JavaScript has also a way to hold a list of data formatting it similar to a JSON file. When looking at the data, most of the UFO sightings happened during the month of January. The data shows that most to all of the UFO sightings have been in the US.
